This was a BI focused project done in the course "Data Warehousing"
Sadly, I cannot provide data for this project, so the files will not be executable for you.
However, there is some interesting SQL in the ETL parts and many visualizations are visible in our final presentation which is also added as file.

This was a group project, the group members are tagged several times along the way.
